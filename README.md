This table contains the **official NATO prowords** used for **radio communication**. For a comprehensive understanding, refer to the [Allied Communications Publication 125 (ACP 125)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACP_125), which details radiotelephone procedures and prowords. Additionally, the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) is used to spell out letters and numbers clearly during transmissions.
