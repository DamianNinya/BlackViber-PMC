This table contains the **official NATO prowords** used for **radio communication**. For a comprehensive understanding, refer to the [Allied Communications Publication 125 (ACP 125)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACP_125), which details radiotelephone procedures and prowords. Additionally, the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) is used to spell out letters and numbers clearly during transmissions.

# NATO Phonetic Alphabet in Communication

The **NATO Phonetic Alphabet** is widely used in radio communications to ensure clear and unambiguous messaging, especially in high-stress or noisy environments. One of its common applications is **numerical communication**, where letters from the phonetic alphabet are used to replace numbers or designate locations.

---

### Numerical Communication Example
In some mission protocols, pre-assigned locations or objectives may be designated using **Alfa, Bravo, Charlie** instead of numbers. This minimizes confusion when transmitting critical information.

For example:
- **Site 1** → **Alfa**
- **Site 2** → **Bravo**
- **Site 3** → **Charlie**

However, **Zero** is always transmitted as "Zero" to avoid confusion with the letter "O."

---

### Example Comms Transmission
Scenario: Team has two exfiltration sites — Site 1 (**Alfa**) and Site 2 (**Bravo**).

**Transmission Example:**
01 Actual, this is Hitman 1, Moving to Alfa, over.  
Hitman 1, this is 01 Actual, say again, over.  
01 Actual, I say again, Moving to Alfa, over.  
Roger, Hitman 1. Moving to Alfa, out.  

---

### Location-Based Designations
In some missions, **Alfa, Bravo, Charlie** may be used to designate key terrain, objectives, or rally points instead of numerical signs. This method helps maintain **OPSEC (Operational Security)** and prevents adversaries from easily identifying locations.

Example Designations:
- **Alfa** → Primary Exfiltration Point  
- **Bravo** → Secondary Rally Point  
- **Charlie** → Supply Cache

### Military Comms Jargon & Phrases
| Term        | Meaning               | Example Usage                 |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Actual** | Unit Leader Call Sign | "Hitman 1, this is 01 Actual, request Sitrep, over." |
| **Sitrep** | Situation Report      | "01 Actual, this is Hitman 2, Sitrep as follows, holding at Bravo, over." |
| **Break**  | Pause between messages | "Contact front, break... Moving to Bravo, over." |
| **Oscar Mike** | On the Move       | "01 Actual, this is Hitman 1, Oscar Mike to Alfa, over." |
| **Solid Copy** | Message received & understood | "Solid Copy, out." |
| **Standby** | Wait for further instruction | "Hitman 2, Standby, over." |
| **Danger Close** | Friendly forces near target | "01 Actual, this is Hitman 1, requesting fire mission... Danger Close, over." |
| **Wilco** | Will Comply          | "Roger, Wilco. Moving to Alfa, out." |
| **Jackpot** | Target Secured     | "Hitman 1, this is 01 Actual, Jackpot. Package secured, over." |

---

### Comms Flow Structure
A standard comms message follows this pattern:

**[Receiver], this is [Sender], [Message], Over.**

✅ Example:  
Hitman 1, this is Hitman 2, Eyes on target, Bravo point secured, over.

---

### Radio Bearings & Distance Explanation
Bearings are used to give precise enemy or point of interest locations by referencing the **compass heading** from your own position.

Bearings are always given in **three-digit format** to avoid confusion.

| Bearing   | Meaning                  |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **0-9-0** | East (090°)            |
| **1-8-0** | South (180°)           |
| **2-7-0** | West (270°)           |
| **3-6-0** | North (360° or 0°)     |
| **2-4-0** | Southwest (240°)       |

---

### Contact Report Example
Scenario: Team is moving to exfil but spots enemy activity.

01 Actual, this is Hitman 1, Contact front, two times foot mobiles, break...  
Bearing 2-4-0, Danger Close, over.  
Hitman 1, this is 01 Actual, Solid Copy... break...  
Hitman 3, shift fire to Bravo, over.  

---

### Final Notes
- Always call **the receiver first**  
- Use **"Say Again"** instead of **"Repeat"**  
- Pause messages with **Break**  
- Confirm orders with **Roger** or **Wilco**  
- If you don't hear **"Over"**, don't reply  
- If you hear **"Out"**, the conversation is **done**
- ALWAYS REFER TO Team Leaders as "Actual" after their call sign
